sinaplot NEWS

Changes in version 0.1.5 (2016-05-14)

- Fixed a bug that was plotting the first and last classes beyond the figure
  margins

Changes in version 0.1.4 (2016-04-19)

- Fixed a bug where the data were reordered after calculating the new x-axis

  with custom colors using sinaplot() + geom_point(col = mycol)


Changes in version 0.1.3 (2015-11-20)

- "groups" are treated as factors and they are plotted in the order that their
levels appear (alphabetically by default) providing a similar output format with
default ggplot2 plots

- NEWS file added
- Changes in vignette compiling. knitr is added as the vignette builder in the
  DESCRIPTION FILE
